# Idleminer

I made this because I always forget to turn on a miner when I leave the computer. It will run on the system tray and start mining after 5 minutes of inactivity, and should stop after any user input.

It's supposed to be used like this:
> Idleminer.exe "C:/some_miner.bat"

The batch file should call whatever miner you want and pass any needed arguments to it.
